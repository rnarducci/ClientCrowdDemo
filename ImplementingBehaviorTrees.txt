- Use import from Dr Ricks in index.html
- Either in constructor or if it doesn't work, in new build function
and create the behavior trees as normal.
- Use this code snippet or something similar to make sure trees
update with each tick. Might be in index.html. Does looping happen 
in test and none already?

- NOTE: threw an error when "await" was left in
public async update(deltaTime: number): Promise<void> {
    await this.tree.tick(new TimeData(deltaTime));
}

- Created behaviors folder for micro scripts for reusability


- Idea for basic behavior tree:
 - walk to point
 - "take vitals" start to port this
 - go back to start or another point
 - "wait forever" start to port this
